# Vizcord ðŸ¤–

A Discord bot meant to push viz manga updates automagically to your discord server.

The current Discord landscape requires you to join random community Discord servers and hope that they push server announcements out to other servers. This is an unreliable way to receive manga news. Some community servers refuse to implement server announcements out of stubborn-ness / lack of knowledge. It may be the case that a user could be banned from a server and is unable to access their announcements channel to set up this integration. Aside from all that, most of these announcements are made by people, leading to room for error / lag between chapter release and server announcement.

The aim of the Vizcord bot is two-fold:
1. Eliminate the need for community servers to push out manga announcements
2. Eliminate the margin for error and lag that comes with a human making these announcements

The following features are key to Vizcord's MVP:
1. Users can choose which manga they want to receive updates for
2. Users will receive a ping when a new chapter for a manga they've subscribed to drops
